# 🤚 AirDJ – Hand-Tracking Audio Controller

**AirDJ** is a real-time hand-tracking audio controller that lets you manipulate music using intuitive hand gestures. By tracking your hands with a webcam, it enables dynamic control of **volume, playback speed, and filter effects**—all without touching any hardware. Perfect for live performance or interactive music experiments.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎶 **Gesture-Based Audio Control**  
  Control multiple aspects of audio in real time using simple hand movements.

- 🔊 **Volume & Low-Pass Filter (Right Hand)**  
  Raise or lower your right hand to adjust volume
  Pinch thumb and index finger to modify low-pass filter cutoff

- ⏩ **Playback Speed (Left Hand)**  
  Pinch thumb and index finger to control speed from slow-motion to fast-forward.

- 👁️ **Live Visual Feedback**  
  Webcam feed displays circles, lines, and text overlays for all controlled parameters.

- ⏱️ **Real-Time Performance**  
  Multithreaded design ensures smooth audio playback, hand tracking, and UI updates simultaneously.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
**🔧 Audio & Signal Processing**   
**Python** - Core language for audio and gesture logic

**Sounddevice & Soundfile** - Real-time playback and file I/O
**SciPy** - Low-pass filter design 
**NumPy** - Efficient numerical operations
**FFmpeg & Pydub** - Audio decoding, slicing, and mixing  
**Multithreading & Parallel Processing** - Accelerates song analysis and rendering  

**💻 Computer Vision & UI**  
**MediaPipe** - Hand tracking and landmark detection
**OpenCV** - Webcam capture and live UI overlay

**⚡ Performance**    
*Multithreading** - Audio runs in a separate thread for uninterrupted playback
